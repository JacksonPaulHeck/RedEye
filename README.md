# RedEye Programming Language

## What this is

The RedEye Programming Langauge is an implementation of a C-Style Language in Rust.
Although there have been many different implementations of programming languages in Rust, one of the goals of RedEye will be to be self-hosted.

The main purpose of this repository is as a learning tool for repository maintaining, project management, compiler design, and compiler implementation.

## Goals
- [ ] Simulation Mode
- [ ] Compilation Mode
- [ ] REPL
- [ ] Self Hosted
